<h3>Welcome to Ansible Environment.How to Install Ansible on CentOS 7</h3>

<h4>Ansible is an open source automation software written in Python. It runs on UNIX-like systems and can provision and configure both UNIX-like and Windows systems. Unlike other automation software, Ansible does not require an agent to run on a target system. It leverages on the SSH connection and python interpreter to perform the given tasks on the target system. Ansible can be installed on a cloud server to manage other cloud servers from a central location, or it can also be configured to use on a personal system to manage cloud or on-premises systems.</h4>
